## About

This project uses the CPT+ algorithm to read input data from the Dataset.txt file in the form of a sequence database and then proceed to build a model to use for future predictions.
In this example, after training the model, we take a test sample of 3 items and ask the algorithm to predict the next 5 items in order from the item with the highest score.

## Compare

To test the effectiveness of the CPT+ algorithm, we can compare it with other algorithms such as DGP, LZ78, etc., but using the same dataset.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
